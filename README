This program will generate a geek code block for you by simply
choosing which codes suit you from the screen. I am not a very good
programmer, I just dabble a little every now and then.

Originally, I started this project in Visual Basic, but decided to use
DJGPP v2 instead, partially because it is free, partially because it is
more portable and partially because Visual Basic sucks :) Since then, I
have totally switched my system to Linux. Currently, my system is
Slackware 4.0 (partially) converted to glibc 2.1.1, but I will be
installing Debian 2.1 very soon.

To use this program, you just run the resulting binary and follow
the directions. Everything SHOULD work, but I haven't tested it
all that much.

If you have any bugs, patches, typos, comments, flames, money, 
postcards, or any other free stuff - feel free to email me
at chris@blackplasma.net - also, please let me know if you modify 
this source, so I can try it myself.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Linux notes:

This program was developed using gcc 2.95.1, glibc 2.1.2, and various
other GNU tools, on Debian GNU/Linux (potato), with the 2.2.12 kernel.

To install on Linux (and most likely other UNIX variants):

    make

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

DOS notes:

DJGPP v2 is available at http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/ including
CWSDPMI, which is also released under the GPL. This executable is
required if your OS doesn't provide DPMI services (Windows 9x does).
You have the right to receive the source for CWSDPMI, as well as any
binary updates. These things should also be available at the site
listed above for DJGPP.

To compile on DOS with DJGPP v2, try this:

	gcc -O3 -s -o geekcode.exe *.c

Also, if you have the DJGPP make package instaled, you can probably
just type make, and ignore any errors you might get (at least, I could
do that in my limited testing on my other system).
