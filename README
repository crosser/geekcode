Geek Code Generator v2 - Generates your geek code

Overview
--------
Geekcode is a small project that generates and translates geekcode.

History
-------
Originally Geekcode was authored by Chris Gushue, who presumably still holds
some copyright on some of the files, although most (if not all) of the
original code has been changed. I built and ran the program one dark evening
in '06, wanted to fix some small bug (which one it was escapes me now), and
was shocked by the massive amounts of unnecessary repetition. I re-wrote a
large part of it, and then emailed Chris. I have not (as yet) received a
reply: Chris, if you're reading this, you're welcome to reclaim this project!
I do not consider this a fork, only a new maintainership.

Building and Installing
-----------------------
Execute `make` to build geekcode, and `make install` to install it.

Windows Notes
-------------
Originally, this built (and presumably ran) on Windows. I do not use Windows,
and have no access to any development tools on it. I've kept the only
compatibility parts (in consoleio.c), in the hope it makes Geekcode work on
Windows, but frankly, I have no interest in pursuing the matter any further.
Any patches improving Windows support will be received gladly.

License
-------
Geekcode is licensed under GPLv2 ONLY.

Todo
----
Things I would still like to implement in Geekcode:
  - Adding support for updating geekcode files.
  - Improved usability.
  - GUI version.
  - Supporting multiple geekcode versions.
