Jun 15 1999

- Started working on this Geek Code Generator project

Jun 16 1999

- Managed to get the selection screens finished, all that is left
  to do now is something to convert each numeric variable to a string
  that will be displayed in the final Geek Code.

Aug 04 1999 (version 1.0)

- Finally got around to finishing this project. No DOS binary for now,
  as I am only running Linux on my system (yay!).

Aug 05 1999

- Cleaned up the code a little bit, currently considering how I should
  go about adding the missing features.

Aug 29 1999 (version 1.1)

- Added Unix Type section (page 7a)
- Fixed a few typos

Aug 30 1999 (version 1.2)

- Diff from Fuzzy Logic <fuzzy@mlug.org> to fix some typos and screen
  postitioning.
- Added a #define for the version number (gee, why didn't I do that
  in the first place).
- Added sex type question, and related changes.
- Various other minor changes.

Aug 31 1999 (version 1.3)
- Fixed a couple more typos
- Added little bit of code for each selection screen so that when a
  non-number is typed, the program doesn't start to loop endlessly.
  The compiler generates a warning about using gets(), so is this actually
  a problem, or is there a better way to do it? (Thanks to the few people
  that told me about these bugs).
- Stuff from Kalle Berg <carbe771@student.liu.se>:
  - Added geekcode.h to store the declarations and such
  - Added Win32-specific screen clearing routine (checked at compile time)

Sep 13 1999 (version 1.4)
- Changed the effective screen size to 80x24 (instead of 80x25)
- Changed gets() to use fgets() - thanks Telsa <hobbit@aloss.ukuu.org.uk>

Sep 20 1999 (version 1.5)
- Some minor typo corrections and changes from Fuzzy Logic <fuzzy@mlug.org>
- Added a Quit function (press 0 on any selection screen)

Nov 23 1999
- Added geekcode.spec for compiling on RedHat systems, 
  from Chris Ausbrooks <weed@bucket.pp.ualr.edu>

Feb 15 2000 (version 1.6)
- Added a dynamic page numbering thing,
  from Ingo Hoffmann <lasombra@infolink.com.br>

Feb 16 2000
- Changed the Makefile to actually -use- the CC variable.

Feb 21 2000 (version 1.7)
- I know I wasn't going to put out another version until Geek Code v4.0
  was released, but Ingo Hoffmann sent me a patch to write your Geek Code
  to geekcode.sig as well as display it on the screen.
- My email has also changed to seymour@lazygenes.net
- The URL for this program is now http://seymour.lazygenes.net/geekcode.html

Jun 25 2003 (version 1.7.2)
- The URL for this project has long since changed to http://geekcode.sf.net
  and my email has also been changed to chris@blackplasma.net
- The main change in this version is the inclusion of a Geek Code translator,
  which is supposed to tell you what your Geek Code means.
  Patch supplied by Nikolas Garofil <nikolas.garofil@pandora.be>
- Changed references of Linux to GNU/Linux, as suggested in a Debian bug.

Jun 30 2003 (version 1.7.3)
- Actually made the GNU/Linux changes
- Tiny bugfix from Xavier Santolaria <xavier@santolaria.net>
